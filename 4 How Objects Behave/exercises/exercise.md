###### Answer

A class can have any number of these: instance variables, getter, setter, method
A method can have only one of these: return
This can be implicity promoted: return, argument
I prefer my instance variable private: encapsulation
It really means "make a copy": pass by value
Only setters should update these: instance variables
A method can have many of these: argument
I return something by definition: getter
I shuoldn't be used with instance variables: public 
I can have many arguements: method
By definition, I take one argument: setter
These help create encapsulation: getter, setter, public, private
I always fly solo: return
