## Who Am I (page 394)
###### Answer

I got the whole GUI, in my hands: frame <br>
Every event type has one of these: source event, event listener <br>
The listener's key method: actionPerformed, controlChange <br>
This method gives JFrame its size: setSize <br>
You add code to this method but never call it: actionPerformed, controllchange, event handler <br>
When the user actually does something, it's an: event <br>
Most of these are event sources: button, check box, text field, ... <br>
I carry data back to the listener: event object <br>
An addXxxListener() method says an object is an: event source <br>
How a listener signs up: addXxxListener <br>
The method where all the graphics code goes: paintComponent <br>
I'm typically bound to an intance: inner instance <br>
The 'g' in (Graphics g), is really of class: Graphics2d <br>
The method that gets paintComponent rolling: repaint <br>
The package where most of the Swinger reside: javax.swing
