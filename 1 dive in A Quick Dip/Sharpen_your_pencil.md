###### Answer
| Java code| Explain |
| ------------- |-------------|
| int size = 27;      | declare an integer varible named 'size' and give it the value 27 |
| String name = "Fido";| declare a string varible named 'name' and give it the value "Fido"|
| Dog myDog = new Dog(name, size);| declare a dog varible named 'myDog' and give it to intilized dog object|
| x = size - 5;|  decarese the value of varible named 'size' by 5 and assign that value to varible named 'x'|
| if (x < 15) myDog.bark(8);| Check if value of varible x is less than 15. if true then call the bark method of object Dog refrenced by varible named 'myDog' with pramater is 8|
| while (x > 3) {| Do the block code inside while loop if x greater than 3|
| myDog.play();| Object was referenced by varible named 'myDog' call play method|
| }| End scoope of while loop|
| int[] numlist = {2, 4, 6, 8};| Declare a list varible named 'numlist' and assign it to a list has 4 element|
| System.out.print("Hello");| Print "Hello" string to the screen |
| System.out.print("Dog: " + name);| Plus "Dog: " string  with the value tring of varible name then print the string value to the screen|
| String num = "8";| Declare a string varible named 'num' and give it the value "8"|
| int z = Interger.parseInt(num);| Convert value of varible named 'num' to integer then assign the value to declared varible named 'z'|
| try {| Try statement |
| readTheFile("myFile.text");| read file have name "myFile.text"|
| }| end try scoope|
| catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {| Catch statement|
| Sytem.out.print("File not found.");| Print "File not found." string to the screen|
| }| End catch scoope|
