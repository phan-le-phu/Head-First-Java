## What's First ?
###### Answer

1. user clicks a Web page link
2. brower requests a .jnlp file from the Web server
3. the Web server sends a .jnlp file to the brower
4. the Web brower starts up the JWS helper app
5. the JWS helper app requests the JAR file
6. the Web server sends a JAR file to the JWS helper app
7. the JWS helper app invokes the JAR's main() method

## True or False
###### Answer

1. The java compiler has a flag, -d the lets you decide where your .class files should go.
2. ~~A JAR is a standard directory where your .class files should reside.
3. ~~When creating a Java Archive you must create a file called jar.mf.~~
4. The supporting file in a Java Archive declares which class has the main() method.

7. Package structures are meaningfully represented using hierachies.
8. ~~Using your company's domain name is not recommended when naming packages.
9. ~~Different classes within a source file can belong to different packages.~~
10. ~~When compiling classes in a package, the -p flag is highly recommended.~~
11. When compiling classes in a package, the full name must mirror the directory tree.
12. Judicious use of the -d flag can help to assure that there are no typos in your class tree.
13. Extracting a JAR with packages will create a directory called meta-inf.
14. Extracting a JAR with packages will create a file called manifest.mf.
15. ~~The JWS helper app always runs in conjunction with a brower.~~
16. ~~JWS application require a .nlp (Network Launch Protocol) file to work properly.~~
17. ~~A JWS's main method is specified in its JAR file.~~
