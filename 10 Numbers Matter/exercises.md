5. Static variable could be used to count the instances of a class.
6. ~~Constructors are called before static variables are initialized.~~
7. MAX_SIZE would be a good name for a final static variable.
8. A static static initiaizer block runs before a class's constructors runs.
9. ~~If a class is marked final, all of its methods must be marked final.~~
10. ~~A final method can only be overridden if its class is extended.~~
11. ~~There is no wrapper class for boolean primitives.~~
12. A wrapper is used when you want to treat a primitive like and object.
